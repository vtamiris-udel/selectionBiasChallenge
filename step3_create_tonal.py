    Create a tonal analysis by dividing the image into a grid and computing
    average brightness in each section. This helps identify tone distribution
    and can be used to tune stippling parameters in Step 2.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    gray_img : np.ndarray
        Grayscale image as 2D array (height, width) with values in [0, 1]
    grid_rows : int
        Number of rows in the analysis grid. Default 16.
    grid_cols : int
        Number of columns in the analysis grid. Default 12.
    return_full_image : bool
        If True, returns a full-size image with box-averaged values expanded
        to fill each grid cell. If False, returns just the grid array.
        Default True.
    
    Returns
    -------
    tonal_img : np.ndarray
        If return_full_image=True: Full-size image (height, width) where each
        grid cell is filled with the average tone value for that section.
        If return_full_image=False: Grid array (grid_rows, grid_cols) with
        average tone values.
    average_tones : np.ndarray
        Grid array (grid_rows, grid_cols) with average tone values for each section
    stats : dict
        Dictionary containing tonal statistics:
        - 'mean': Overall mean tone

        - 'min': Minimum tone value
